Problem statement
``` 
Hi, I want to integrate aircraft flight data onto a website. Can you help me do this/is this something you would know how to do? I am looking to get it done today as well and am willing to pay a bit more for that. https://aviation-edge.com/aviation-api-list/. 
I am looking to scrape flight data when a user types in their flight number and I want it to tell them whether or not they are flying a 737 8 MAX, so like an If statement
```

Running instructions
``` 
0. Install Python 3.5
1. Download this repo as a zip file and extract
2. Run python main.py
3. Input your flight number
4. If Yes pops up, you are flying on a 737 Max 8
5. If No pops up, there is a high chance that you are not flying in a Max 8 (subject to addition of data and schedule changes)
6. To quit, type "quit" and the program exits
```
